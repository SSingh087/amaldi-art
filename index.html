Lulù Nuti collected inspirations from the world of gravitational astronomy, fundamental physics and technological research and engaged in a dialogue with researchers from EGO and Virgo. The work reflects ideas of symmetry and balance, evoking a deeper, invisible level of reality that somehow, however, ‘sustains’ ordinary reality.  It expresses on an aesthetic level concepts that have profoundly to do with the worldview of fundamental physics. The project has been supported by the CAOS laboratory of the University of Perugia and the National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN)."

Einstein has shown that actually mass and energy deform space and alter time. For example, in the cosmos, violent collisions of massive bodies are able to generate ripples, which propagate through the fabric of space-time: gravitational waves. In this installation you can deform and warp space-time, as if you were a star, a supernova or a black hole. <br> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYbPqX47Swg'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYbPqX47Swg</a>."
