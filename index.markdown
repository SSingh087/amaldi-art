<p>You are invited to share your creativity by taking part in our science and art exhibition at this yearâ€™s GR-Amaldi.

We will display as many pieces as possible for conference participants to view during the week as well as on our online gallery for all to enjoy.</p>

<p>Artworks related to the topics of GR-Amaldi are especially welcome. GR-Amaldi topics include classical and quantum gravity, mathematical and applied relativity, gravitational-wave instrumentation and data analysis, multimessenger astronomy, relativistic astrophysics and cosmology, as well as education, outreach and community building in support of these areas.</p>
