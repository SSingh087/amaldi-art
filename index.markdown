  The Institute for Gravitational Research is pleased to announce the 2025 edition of the AIslands workshop series, which will be hosted in Rothesay on the Isle of Bute.

  The Bute meeting will update on developments in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence in gravitational-wave astronomy since the 2024 meeting on Arran.

  The AIslands meetings are discussion meetings intended to provide an environment which will nurture collaboration and network building.
  We invite expressions of interest from across gravitational-wave science, which can be made [on this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=KVxybjp2UE-B8i4lTwEzyAeVMi1YdgpEhWxbcgUCGgVUMlo5NDNIUVZCTEwxOTVRMVI5UFdCTEFHTy4u).

  We are currently in the process of finalising arrangements, but we hope to keep the registration fee low, but expect it to cover the cost of a networking meal.
  Rothesay has excellent options for dining and refreshments during the course of the meeting.
